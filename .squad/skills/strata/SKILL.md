# Strata CLI — Team Skill

> **Scope:** Haven project — first production use of strata (xyz-strata v0.0.x)
> **Maintainers:** Kaylee (infra), Zoe (validation) — both append surprises here
> **Confidence:** low (early adopter, actively accumulating)

This file captures what the team has learned about strata's actual behavior — especially where it diverges from expectations. It is the primary feedback channel from the team to the strata developers (Vincent).

## Known Facts

- **Binary location:** `C:\Users\VHUYBREC\.local\bin\strata.exe`
- **`strata` is NOT on PATH** — must use full path or set an alias. Run `uv tool update-shell` to fix permanently.
- **Install command:** `uv tool install e:\SourcesXYZ\strata`
- **Supported kinds:** `configuration`, `deployment`, `environment`, `firewall`, `module`, `namespace`, `platform_model`, `provider`, `resource`, `workspace`
- **Templates available for `strata new`:** `configuration`, `firewall`, `module`, `namespace`, `provider`, `resource`, `workspace` (note: `deployment` and `environment` are NOT available as templates)
- **Validate syntax:** `strata validate <file-path>` — one file at a time; no glob support observed
- **Deep validation:** `strata validate --deep <file>` — requires initialized workspace with active profile

## Observed Surprises

### 2026-05-29 — apiVersion enum mismatch (Kaylee + Zoe)

**What happened:** `strata validate` on `dc-hetzner-eu-de.yaml` failed with:
```
Field 'apiVersion': must be one of: 'platform.huybrechts.xyz/v1' (type: enum)
```
The file used `strata.huybrechts.xyz/v1` which is the value shown in all existing YAML examples.

**Resolution:** The schema validator expects `platform.huybrechts.xyz/v1` but the canonical value in the codebase is `strata.huybrechts.xyz/v1`. Vincent confirmed `strata.huybrechts.xyz/v1` is correct — the schema is outdated. An `update` command is being built to migrate this in bulk when the schema is updated.

**Status:** Known — schema fix + `strata update` command pending. Keep `strata.huybrechts.xyz/v1` in all files for now.

## Open Questions

- Does `strata validate --deep` require a `strata profile add` to be run first?
- Does `strata build` / `strata deploy` work standalone or require a full solution setup?
- Are `deployment` and `environment` kinds intentionally excluded from `strata new` templates?
