# Workspace README

This `.strata` folder contains workspace state and helper files created by the Strata CLI.

Included files:

- `logging.yaml` — development logging configuration for local runs
- `cli.yaml` — CLI preference values for the workspace
- `.gitignore` — files to ignore from the `.strata` folder
- `integrations/` — per-integration help documents (one markdown file per integration)

## Using the integration docs

Each file under `.platform/integrations/` documents how to configure and use an integration (for example, `azure_keyvault.md`, `git.md`, `terraform.md`). Use these documents as the first-stop reference when wiring credentials, environment variables, or diagnosing common issues.

Examples:

- To see the Azure Key Vault guide: open `.platform/integrations/azure_keyvault.md`
- To find quick Git setup instructions: open `.platform/integrations/git.md`
- To find Bitwarden Secrets Manager setup: open `.platform/integrations/bitwarden.md`

## Customising

You can safely edit these files in your workspace to add project-specific notes (for example, the vault name to use in your environment or a private registry URL). Local edits are intended to be committed into your repository.
